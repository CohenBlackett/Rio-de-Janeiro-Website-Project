<h2>About Escadaria selarón</h2>
    <p>Escadaria Selarón, locally known as the 'Lapa Steps' (Escadaria da Lapa) for being situated at the "Lapa" neighborhood, is a set of world-famous steps in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They are the work of Chilean-born artist Jorge Selarón who claimed it as "my tribute to the Brazilian people".</p>

<h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
<li>

<ul>It features a recurring artistic theme: Among the thousands of tiles, you can spot a repeated image of a pregnant African woman. Selarón included about 300 of these tiles, which he hand-painted himself, but he never commented on their meaning beyond calling it a "personal problem from my past". </ul>
<ul>It's a music video star: The iconic steps have been featured in numerous commercials and music videos. The most famous is probably Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams's 2003 song "Beautiful". </ul>
<ul>The artist considered it unfinished: Selarón worked on the project for 23 years, right up until his death in 2013. He constantly changed and updated the steps and once said, "This crazy and unique dream will only end on the day of my death".</ul>
<ul>It's a global work of art: The mosaic-covered steps feature more than 2,000 tiles collected from over 60 countries. The project started with Selarón using salvaged tiles from construction sites around the city, but it evolved as visitors from around the world began to donate tiles to him. </ul>
