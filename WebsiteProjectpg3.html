<h2>About Pão de Açúcar</h2>
<p>Pão de Açúcar, or Sugarloaf Mountain, is a prominent peak in Rio de Janeiro known for its 360-degree panoramic views of the city, beaches, and Guanabara Bay. A cable car system takes visitors from Praia Vermelha (Red Beach) to the top of Sugarloaf, making a stop at the smaller Morro da Urca hill along the way. The name "Sugarloaf" refers to the mountain's shape, which resembles a traditional block of refined sugar. </p>
    
<h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
<li>

<ul>It hosts one of the world's oldest cable car systems: The first cable car, or bondinho, was inaugurated in 1912, making it the first in Brazil and the third in the world. The original system was upgraded in 1972 and again in 2008, but it still follows the same breathtaking route.</ul>
<ul>It's part of a UNESCO World Heritage site: In 2012, UNESCO declared the "Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea" a World Heritage Site. This area includes not only Sugarloaf Mountain but also other iconic Rio landmarks like the Christ the Redeemer statue and Copacabana beach.</ul>
<ul>You can hike part of the way to the top: While many visitors take the scenic cable car the whole way, a hiking trail leads up the first peak, Morro da Urca. This 30-to-40-minute trail is popular with locals and saves you the cost of the first cable car ticket. From Morro da Urca, you can take the second cable car to the final summit.</ul>
<ul>Its name comes from refined sugar cones: In the 16th and 17th centuries, blocks of refined sugar were clumped together and transported in a conical shape. When Portuguese colonists first saw the mountain, its distinct form reminded them of these sugar cones, leading to the name "Pão de Açúcar," or "Sugarloaf".</ul>
