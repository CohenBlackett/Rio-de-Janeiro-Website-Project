    <h2>About O Cristo Redentor</h2>
    <p>The Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor) statue is a large Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Perched atop the 700-meter-high Corcovado mountain, the statue has become a global symbol of Christianity, as well as a cultural icon for both Rio de Janeiro and all of Brazil. </p>

    <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>

    <li>

<ul>The statue is frequently struck by lightning: Due to its position atop Corcovado mountain, it is hit several times a year during storms. A particularly intense storm in 2014 damaged the statue's thumb and head.</ul>
<ul>There is a chapel at the base of the statue: The small Catholic chapel is dedicated to Our Lady of Aparecida, the patron saint of Brazil, and can be used for weddings and baptisms. </ul>
<ul>The head and hands of the statue were sculpted in France: Though the monument was a collaboration of several designers, the Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa worked with the Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski and the French engineer Albert Caquot to bring the statue to life.</ul>
<ul>The statue was originally designed differently: An earlier version by engineer Heitor da Silva Costa depicted Christ carrying a large cross in one hand and a globe in the other. The final version, with Christ's arms spread wide, was chosen instead.</ul>
